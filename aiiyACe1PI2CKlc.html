                    <h3>How to start investing (for beginners))</h3>

                    <p>
                        <strong></strong> Investing is becoming increasingly popular among people, because it is extremely easy to do so.And with a significant increase in the stock market it can be done with extraordinary ease.In this article, we will talk about how to start investing.To do this, we will take a closer look at the main points that are sure to lead you to significant financial capital:1) Stop asking "small" questions.For the money you will never have to answer such questions as, "How much did I invest this month?", "How much did I pay this year?", "Where can I invest now?"These questions "pull" money out of your stash and, as a result, you will never be able to accurately answer the following question::how much did I invest this month?2) What is the average maturity of my investments?This is probably the most important step of all.Don't keep 100% in stocks and other financial instruments. Keep your money in a "safe" Bank Deposit (or on a Bank Deposit).Your investment portfolio should also include: bonds (in the form of Bank deposits and bonds of various colors);shares (through the purchase of index mutual Funds or ETFs);real estate (by buying real estate funds or by renting it out);drag.metals (by providing your own mining and jewelry services);etc.3) Smart investments.To invest smart, you should make a good habit of buying currency, stocks, and other financial instruments every month (monthly, weekly, or whenever you are ready to spend your money on other things).This will allow you to gradually form an impressive capital, the income from which will be fully realized.4) " Smart " investing.It is important to understand how your money works, and how the stock market works.It is also important to understand how difficult it is to predict how the dollar or gold will move. "What if..."?These questions "push" money away from you and onto your investment â€” making it more likely that you will lose money on investments (and you will not even make a profit on them).5) " Smart " investment strategy.It has long been proven that a high percentage of the investments of your clientele are fraudulent.Therefore, your strategy should be extremely simple: stick only to index investing;use the monthly averaging strategy when buying index funds;use the "Buy back strong" rule;do not buy shares in long-term funds;limit yourself to index investing.Executive SUMMARY:1. In your head, you should think about all these steps (and you are guaranteed to get rich from it).2. You can't do that. Because your head is in the clouds. 1) Read my article " Where NOT to invest money? TOP 3 most dangerous places for money". 2) Read my article " what skills do you need to become
